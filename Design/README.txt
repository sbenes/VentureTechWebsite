This directory is automatically created to store design files such as images.
Files in this directory are intended to be referenced from CSS files and occasionally from components.
Since they are part of the design, it is a good idea to WRITE protect the directory and it's subdirectories.
Permission protecting the directory will prevent content editors and other maintainers of the site from accidentally changing the design.
Do this by changing the permissions on this directory and applying the permissions / protections to children as well.
Don't set a READ protection as this will prevent the files from being loaded by visitors of the site.
